> List of articles, projects, books with small annotations, my comments and (may be) pros and cons.

## Testing
+ [Fakeit](https://github.com/brianvoe/gofakeit) - random data generator with over 160 functions. You can create your own functions, can fire up built in local server to test functions.
+ [Testfixtures](https://github.com/go-testfixtures/testfixtures) - helps with functional testing, keeping fixture data in yml files.

## Slices
+ [Slice tricks](https://ueokande.github.io/go-slice-tricks/) - cheat sheet for common slice operations.
+ [Bad go slice of pointers](https://philpearl.github.io/post/bad_go_slice_of_pointers/) - why you should not use slice of pointers in most cases

## Project Structure
+ [Cli project structure](https://bencane.com/2020/12/29/how-to-structure-a-golang-cli-project/) - describes simple structure of cli project.

## Gotchas
+ [Cmd dev null](https://rohitpaulk.com/articles/cmd-run-dev-null) - if either one of Cmd.Stdout, Cmd.Stderr, Cmd.Stdin are not explicitly set, Go sets them to /dev/null. This can cause failures when using Cmd.Run in Go programs that execute in environments where /dev/null isnâ€™t accessible. To fix this, either assign dummy values to Cmd.Stdout, Cmd.Stderr and Cmd.Stdin, or ensure that /dev/null is accessible.
+ [50 Shades of Go](http://devs.cloudimmunity.com/gotchas-and-common-mistakes-in-go-golang/index.html) - Traps, Gotchas, and Common Mistakes, especially useful for New Golang Devs.

## Compiler
+ [Why Go compiles so fast](https://devrajcoder.medium.com/why-go-compiles-so-fast-772435b6bd86) - Go is one of the fastest compiling programming languages out there. It compiles faster than most of the programming languages, like C/C++, Java, Rust, etc. Since the existing large codebase at Google used to take long hours to build, the quick compilation was one of the most important requirements during the creation of Golang at Google.
